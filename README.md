# Story behind it

This project was proposed by Holberton School as the last one of the first
trimester of full-stack specialization.This webpage has been designed by Nicolas
Philippot, UI/UX designer.

# Features

HTML - CSS and, Bootstrap integration adding it to i jQuery. Some API Rest
requests were made and it has a little filter in the courses section.

# Future features

It would be nice to re-implement this project using React, Angular or Vue in
order to improve its responses and make it even faster.

# Challenges

I must say it was quite challenging beacause I had never built a website from
zero all alone and less using jQuery which is kind of a deprecated technology
nowadays. It was really fun to do it though. Another thing I should mention is
that this project was done by looking at some Figma prototypes which made it
even harder to complete it.
